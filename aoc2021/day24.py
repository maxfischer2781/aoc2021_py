# So... there is no solution here from me for this day. 🤷‍
# Turns out most people solved this problem mostly by hand:
# manually simplify the instructions before brute-forcing
# what is left. There are some cool instructions patterns
# such using mod/div to use numbers as a stack of digits.
#
# Writing an automatic solver for this is a nice pet project.
# It also takes a metric ton of time and research which I
# felt is not worth it for a toy problem.
