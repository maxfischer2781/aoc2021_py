# - up to four times as a neighbour to compare to

# we find a low point. However, this inefficiency is a small overhead and alternatives

# It does not matter where we start collecting: Each point will eventually
# neighbour-recurse through the entire basin but no further. By removing points
# as we collect them into clusters, once we have a complete cluster we are
# guaranteed that the left-over points belong to a new cluster.
