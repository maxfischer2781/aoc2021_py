Solutions for `Advent of Code <https://adventofcode.com>`_ 2021 in pure Python 3.9. 🎄
No dependencies, no speed hacks:
pythonic code with just the standard library. 👍
Well, unless I'm too annoyed by the challenge of the day. 🤪

Starting at day 5, the code includes comments on coding patterns and algorithms. 📝
This should keep the code understandable even for people new to Python or
not familiar with the specific algorithm. 🤔

Usage 🎅🤶
--------

The module is directly executable from the CLI.

.. code:: bash

    # run day 3
    python3 -m aoc2021 3
    # run day 4 with example code
    python3 -m aoc2021 4 -e
    # run days 1,2,3,4,5
    python3 -m aoc2021 1 2 3 4 5
    # show available options
    python3 -m aoc2021 -h

The data of my own challenge and the example data is part of the repo.
Use the ``--data`` switch to point to a custom data location.
